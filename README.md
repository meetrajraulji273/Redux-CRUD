# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

=======
Redux-CRUD
Redux-CRUD is a library that simplifies CRUD operations in Redux, designed to streamline data management in React applications.

Features
CRUD Operations: Easily perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in Redux.
Normalized State: Manage normalized state structures for efficient data storage.
API Integration: Seamlessly integrate with APIs for persistent data management.
Action Creators: Includes action creators for standard CRUD operations.
Middleware Support: Works well with Redux middleware for async operations.

Installation
You can install Redux-CRUD via npm or yarn:
npm install redux-crud
# or
yarn add redux-crud

Usage
Setup
To integrate Redux-CRUD into your project, follow these steps:

Setup Redux Store:

// Configure your Redux store with redux-crud reducer
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { crudReducer } from 'redux-crud';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // other reducers,
  crud: crudReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

// Configure your Redux store with redux-crud reducer
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { crudReducer } from 'redux-crud';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // other reducers,
  crud: crudReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

Configure API Endpoints:

// Configure your API endpoints
import { configureCrud } from 'redux-crud';

configureCrud({
  baseApiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  resources: {
    // Define your resources and their API paths
    users: '/users',
    posts: '/posts',
    // Add more resources as needed
  },
});

Example Usage
Once configured, use Redux-CRUD action creators in your components or Redux middleware:

import { createRecord, fetchRecords, updateRecord, deleteRecord } from 'redux-crud';

// Example usage
store.dispatch(createRecord('users', { name: 'John Doe' }));
store.dispatch(fetchRecords('users'));
store.dispatch(updateRecord('users', 1, { name: 'Jane Doe' }));
store.dispatch(deleteRecord('users', 1));
