Redux-CRUD
Redux-CRUD is a library that simplifies CRUD operations in Redux, designed to streamline data management in React applications.

Features
CRUD Operations: Easily perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in Redux.
Normalized State: Manage normalized state structures for efficient data storage.
API Integration: Seamlessly integrate with APIs for persistent data management.
Action Creators: Includes action creators for standard CRUD operations.
Middleware Support: Works well with Redux middleware for async operations.

Installation
You can install Redux-CRUD via npm or yarn:
npm install redux-crud
# or
yarn add redux-crud

Usage
Setup
To integrate Redux-CRUD into your project, follow these steps:

Setup Redux Store:

// Configure your Redux store with redux-crud reducer
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { crudReducer } from 'redux-crud';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // other reducers,
  crud: crudReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

// Configure your Redux store with redux-crud reducer
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { crudReducer } from 'redux-crud';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  // other reducers,
  crud: crudReducer,
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

Configure API Endpoints:

// Configure your API endpoints
import { configureCrud } from 'redux-crud';

configureCrud({
  baseApiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  resources: {
    // Define your resources and their API paths
    users: '/users',
    posts: '/posts',
    // Add more resources as needed
  },
});

Example Usage
Once configured, use Redux-CRUD action creators in your components or Redux middleware:

import { createRecord, fetchRecords, updateRecord, deleteRecord } from 'redux-crud';

// Example usage
store.dispatch(createRecord('users', { name: 'John Doe' }));
store.dispatch(fetchRecords('users'));
store.dispatch(updateRecord('users', 1, { name: 'Jane Doe' }));
store.dispatch(deleteRecord('users', 1));
